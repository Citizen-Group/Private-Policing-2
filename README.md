This is an **Expo** project creating an multi-deployment app for road law enforcement -  currently called RoadLens.

## Get started

You'll need OpenJDK 17 to be able to compile android emulation builds

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   npm start web
   ```

If you do

   ```bash
   npm run android
   ```

Easiest to just DL the Android Studio and let it do the all the configs.
